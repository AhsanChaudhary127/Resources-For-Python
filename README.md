**1. Learning Python**
For learning Python, Many resources are available. Starting with YT channels, The best one I found yet is 
[Code with Harry](https://youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)
and specifically [This Python playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg). Another great YT channel that I would recommend is [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtube.com/@freecodecamp/). [This basic Playlist](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkmRvnFmOd4KhDdlK1oIq23) contains all the basic python Programming tutorials
Now talking about Other Sources There are a lot of Free and Paid courses on Udemy which also provides certificates. You can found a dozen of courses on my udemy account about Python. 
If we talk about Mobile apps then the best ones I like are [M1M0](https://files.modyolo.com/Mimo/Mimo_v4.4_Patched.apk)  & [Programming Hero](https://hole.apkdone.download/s/TpbfFiKAXLAM5n8/download). You can Download them by clicking the Names above 

**2. Practising Python**
For practising python, There are more services available than you'll ever imagine.
### For Example :
These are some popular ones.

On these websites you can practise from beggining level to expert in different programming languages, Python being one. 
### Executing Code
To execute code many services are available Offline and Online. If you are using a Android or IOS device, Then The Python Ide I recommend the most is `Pydroid3`. It has great features and benefits. You get an IDE, A compiler and Text editor with seperate PIP window to install packages & modules with just a click. 
Now talking about laptop or Pc users, I don't really recommend any online service as Its slow and not easily available if Internet goes bad. VS Code is great but If you are just a beginner, You wouldn't want to spend a whole day figuring out extensions and stuff. I really recommend [PyCharm](https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-edu-2022.2.2.exe?_gl=1*svh731*_ga*MTA2NzYwNzQzMy4xNjg3NTA2OTk4*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTY4NzUwNjk5Ny4xLjAuMTY4NzUwNjk5OS4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.108732866.1529551602.1687506998-1067607433.1687506998) .

To run Pycharm, You need Pycharm as well as [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe) .

If You use Windows 7, I recommend Python version 3.3. Anything above Windows 7 and you can use The latest 3.11.x version.
And remember to tick the box saying add to Path while installing Python. 
While using Pycharm, Don't get so organised in a sense that don't create a new progect for every file. Make one project and create different filess. This will help you to save storage.
